# Sup n' Sip

Sup n' Sip is a web application that builds recipes based on food items the user enters into a form. It also does the same thing for 
drinks, so a user can cook an entire meal using the app. The site can be found here:

Mission Statement

Given that food is a human necessity, we have streamlined the process of making dinner, using limited resources. Our app will generate food and drink recipes depending on what ingredients are available to the user. It will also give suggestions for food items you might be missing to cook richer foods, so that you can turn your cooking idea into an edible masterpiece. 

Why Sup 'n' Sip

Have you ever looked at the food in your pantry and wondered what meals you could make with it? Stuck having to order takeout again because you do not know what meals you can make? Try the Sup n’ Sip app!
Sup n’ Sip is a browser application that takes in a number of food items and returns not just a list of meals that can be prepared with those food items, but also the recipes to follow for preparing those meals. It does the same thing for drinks.

Development Process

The application was built using HTML, Bulma, Javascript and jQuery. The site makes a number of calls to third-party APIs, and builds recipes from the data obtained from those APIs
John and Chidi worked on building the front-end portion of the application, while Mike and Nat wrote the code that interacted with the third-party APIs, and drew data from them. 
Once the site was up and the code was running, all team members came together and improved the site to meet user expectations.

Front End Development

The layout of the website was built entirely using HTML and Bulma, a CSS library.
The user can interact with the site through the input area under the grocery bag, and the buttons on the site. This was done via Javascript.

Back End Development

The recipe data for the food and drinks was obtained from the following APIs: Edamam for food recipes, and the CocktailDB for drink recipes.
The data from the APIs was obtained using jQuery; specifically using an Ajax call.

Future Agile Development Projects

The site could suggest recipes based on the foods you currently have, and rank the recipes based on data from the Edamam API.
We could also add functionality for making other kinds of meals like desserts and fast food.
Adding images to the recipes.
Utilizing local storage to house favorite recipes.
Adding mobile functionality, and barscanning.
